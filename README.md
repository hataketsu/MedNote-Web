# MedNote-Web

My weekend project, it's an Laravel web app which in a pair with another project MedNote-App.

It's able to create, edit, delete note and synchronize notes with the mobile app.

Right now it's for only one person using, not multi users but this feature will be added soon.

Technology: PHP, Laravel, SQLite, Semantic UI

The funny thing is I use SQLite for this project, not MySQL so you don't have to setup a fully working MySQL database to test. Just use "php artisan serve" at the root folder or "php -S localhost:8080" in /public folder and it's done.
